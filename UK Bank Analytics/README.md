# Project Description

This project involved developing an interactive Tableau dashboard to visualize and analyze customer demographics and financial data for UK Banks. The key objectives were to:

### Visualize the regional distribution of customers and their finanical metrics 
- Analyze the distribution of customer account balances
- Explore age distribution trends across various regions in the UK
- Examine customer segmentation by job classification and gender
- Provide actionable insights for improving customer service, targeting strategies, and resource allocation

The The dashboard integrates data from UK banks, enabling users to explore key metrics interactively using filters for region, balance groups, and age groups.

### Key visualizations include:
-  UK Map: Regional customer distribution with numerical breakdowns across England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
-  Distribution by Balance: A bar chart showing the percentage of customers across different account balance ranges.
-  Distribution by Age: A histogram highlighting age-based customer demographics.
-  Gender Breakdown: A pie chart visualizing the gender ratio among customers.
-  Job Classification: A treemap categorizing customers into White Collar, Blue Collar, and Other job roles, providing insights into occupational segmentation.

This dashboard helps bank managers, analysts, and decision-makers gain a clearer understanding of their customers, spot trends in financial behavior, and customize services to better meet the needs of different groups and UK regions.
